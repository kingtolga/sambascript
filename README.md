My Personal collection

Hi all

I'm aware that there are numerous smb conf examples available on the internet, 
but I thought I'd share my personal configuration in case it can help others get their linux file sharing up and running.

The following examples in my repo has worked on:

  * MxLinux
  * LinuxMint
  * Fedora
  * RockyLinux 9
  
My script file only works on the debian / ubuntu Derivative systems



Regards,
Tolga
