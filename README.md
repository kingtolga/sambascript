### My Personal collection of scripts for linux install etc

##### July 31, 2022

Hi all

I'm aware that there are numerous smb conf examples available on the internet, 
but I thought I'd share my personal configuration in case it can help others get their linux file sharing up and running.

The following examples in my repo has worked on:
```
- MxLinux
- LinuxMint
- Fedora
- RockyLinux 9
```
My script file only works on the debian / ubuntu Derivative systems


Regards,
Tolga	:grinning:
